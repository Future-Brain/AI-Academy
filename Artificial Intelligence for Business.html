        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>With Artificial Intelligence, you can do three main things for any business:

            Optimize Business Processes
            
            Minimize Costs
            
            Maximize Revenues
            
            We will show you exactly how to succeed these applications, through Real World Business case studies. And for each of these applications we will build a separate AI to solve the challenge.
            
            
            In Part 1 - Optimizing Processes, we will build an AI that will optimize the flows in an E-Commerce warehouse.
            
            In Part 2 - Minimizing Costs, we will build a more advanced AI that will minimize the costs in energy consumption of a data center by more than 50%! Just as Google did last year thanks to DeepMind.
            
            In Part 3 - Maximizing Revenues, we will build a different AI that will maximize revenue of an Online Retail Business, making it earn more than 1 Billion dollars in revenue!
            
            
            
            But that's not all, this time, and for the first time, weâ€™ve prepared a huge innovation for you. With this course, you will get an incredible extra product, highly valuable for your career:
