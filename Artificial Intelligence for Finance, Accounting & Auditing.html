        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This course will provide students and professionals a 360 degree view of the current Artificial Intelligence
            techniques used in Business, Finance, Accounting and Auditing. Through a mix of lectures, hands-on exercises
            (code free!), case studies, reflection exercises and knowledge-check quizzes, this course will provide a
            quick and deep overview of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in business.

            In this digital age, all careers have a computing element as digitization and automation comes to the
            forefront of business processes. Those who complete this course will be able to reposition themselves to
            initiate and implement AI innovation within their teams, and confidently walk into this AI age.

            The 8 AI techniques that will be covered in this course include:
