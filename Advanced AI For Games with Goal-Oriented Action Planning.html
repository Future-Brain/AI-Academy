        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Goal-Oriented Action Planning (GOAP) is an AI architecture that provides game characters with the ability to
            select goals and make plans to achieve those goals based on the state of the environment and available
            resources. It can be used across a wide range of game genres from first-person shooters to real-time
            strategies, to develop intelligent characters capable of making smart decisions without the need for large
            finite state machines.
