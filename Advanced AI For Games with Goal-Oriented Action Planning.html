        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
           
            Goal-Oriented Action Planning (GOAP) is an AI architecture that provides game characters with the ability to
            select goals and make plans to achieve those goals based on the state of the environment and available
            resources. It can be used across a wide range of game genres from first-person shooters to real-time
            strategies, to develop intelligent characters capable of making smart decisions without the need for large
            finite state machines.
            The codebase is deceptively simple and yet logical, reusable and extremely powerful.
            The library is written in C# and implemented in Unity V.2019, however will easily port to other
            applications.In this course, Penny demystifies the advanced AI technique of GOAP used for creating
            believable and intelligent game characters in games using her internationally acclaimed teaching style and
            knowledge from over 25 years working with games, graphics and having written two award-winning books on
            games AI. Throughout, you will follow along with hands-on workshops designed to take you through every step
            of putting together your own GOAP API. You will build the entire GOAP library from the ground up while
            building a hospital simulation scenario in parallel, to test the API as you go.
